![ralle flyer](images/ralle_flyer.png)

We are a movement of staff at Johns Hopkins University organizing a union in order to win improvements in our working conditions and demand dignity, respect, and a contract. In labs and offices across the university, staff workers at JHU make the research being done here some of the best in the world.

We are affiliated with United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers (UE). We share their belief that unions are for everyone, and that a member-led and organized union is the best way to achieve wins for workers.

Why should we unionize?
======
![ralle group](images/ralle_group.png)
A union contract guarantees a minimum baseline of compensation, workplace expectations, and protection for research staff members across campuses. 

Without a contract, the administration does not have to consult us about changes to our labor conditions and can roll back past wins over time.

Once you are in a union, there is always somebody there to back you up.
