      <div class="faq-item" id="what-is-ralle">
        <h3>What is RALLE?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>RALLE (Research and Lab Labor Empowered) is a movement of research and lab staff at Johns Hopkins University organizing a union to win improvements in our working conditions and demand dignity, respect, and a contract. We are affiliated with United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers (UE).</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" id="who-is-ue">
        <h3>Who is UE?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The <a href="https://www.ueunion.org/">United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE)</a> is a democratic, rank-and-file union with a long history of fighting for workers' rights since the 1930s. UE is known for its member-driven structure and advocacy for social justice. UE represents academic workers across the country and believes that unions are for everyone.</p>

      <div class="faq-item" id="why-union">
        <h3>What is a union and why do we need one at JHU?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A union gives workers collective bargaining power to negotiate the terms of our employment. Without a union, the university has unilateral control over our salaries, benefits, and working conditions. A union contract guarantees a minimum baseline of compensation, workplace expectations, and protection for research staff members across campuses.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" id="other-unions">
        <h3>Do other research staff unions exist?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes! Research staff and postdocs are unionized at many universities including <a href="https://www.studentworkersofcolumbia.com/">Columbia</a>, the <a href="https://www.uaw4811.org/">UC system</a>, <a href="https://getup-uaw.org/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href="https://rutgersaaup.org/our-history/">Rutgers</a>. There are also other bargaining units at Johns Hopkins. Graduate students at JHU formed <a href="https://trujhu.org/">TRU-UE</a> and successfully negotiated their first contract.</p>

      <div class="faq-item" id="who-can-join">
        <h3>Who can join RALLE?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Research staff and lab workers employed by Johns Hopkins University who work on scientific research projects or in research laboratories. This includes lab technicians, research coordinators, and similar positions who are not supervisors or managers.</p>
          <p>If you're not sure if you're eligible, we encourage you to sign a card! We will get in touch with you to follow up if needed.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" id="international-workers">
        <h3>Can international workers join?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes! Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects the organizing rights of all workers regardless of visa status or immigration status. International workers have the same legal rights to organize as citizens and residents.</p>

            <li>Gather authorization cards from workers</li>
            <li>Seek recognition from the employer</li>

            <li>Negotiate a contract</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" id="get-involved">
        <h3>How can I get involved?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>You can:</p>
          <ul style="padding-left: 1.25rem;">
            <li>Fill out our <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ralle-petition">interest form</a> to register your interest</li>
            <li>Sign up for an <a href="https://forms.gle/soJMaRocy4XQvN6q7">info session</a> to learn more</li>
            <li>Join the organizing committee to help build the movement</li>
            <li>Talk to your coworkers about unionizing</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" id="retaliation">
        <h3>Can the university retaliate against workers for unionizing?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>No. The National Labor Relations Act protects workers' rights to organize and join unions. Retaliation against workers for union activity is illegal. If you experience retaliation, contact the organizing committee immediately.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" id="pi-relationship">
        <h3>Will unionizing affect my relationship with my PI or supervisor?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The NLRA protects organizing activities from retaliation. Contract negotiations occur with university administration, not individual PIs or supervisors. A union aims to improve working conditions that support high-quality research, not to interfere with the research process or mentor relationships.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" id="fees">
        <h3>Are there membership fees?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>There are no fees or dues until after a contract has been negotiated and ratified by the membership. Once dues begin, members typically pay a small percentage of gross compensation (usually around 1.4 - 1.5%). These dues fund union operations and support services for members.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" id="lab-funding">
        <h3>Will salary increases hurt lab funding or PI grants?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Universities like Princeton and MIT have funded stipend increases through institutional budgets rather than burdening individual research labs. Johns Hopkins has substantial resources including a large endowment and significant overhead revenue from grants that can support improved compensation without impacting individual lab budgets.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" id="affordability">
        <h3>How can Hopkins afford better compensation for research staff?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Hopkins controls substantial overhead revenue from grants, holds a multi-billion dollar endowment with significant unrestricted reserves, and regularly reports budget surpluses. The university has the financial capacity to improve research staff compensation and working conditions.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" id="contract">
        <h3>What is a union contract?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A union contract is a binding legal agreement between the employer and employees that establishes minimum standards for compensation, benefits, and working conditions. The contract is negotiated collectively and must be ratified (approved) by union members before taking effect.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" id="strike">
        <h3>Will we have to go on strike?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Strikes require authorization from a supermajority of members. Many academic unions have successfully negotiated strong contracts without ever going on strike. A strike is always a democratic decision made by the membership.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" id="become-member">
        <h3>How do I become a member?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Once we have a ratified contract, you can become a member by completing a membership authorization form and agreeing to pay monthly membership dues. Members gain voting rights and full participation in union governance.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" id="after-vote">
        <h3>What happens after we vote to unionize?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <ol style="padding-left: 1.25rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
            <li>Elect a bargaining committee from among the membership</li>
            <li>Survey members about priorities for contract negotiations</li>
            <li>Negotiate a first contract with the university</li>
            <li>Bring the proposed contract back to the membership for ratification</li>
            <li>Once ratified, the contract goes into effect</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>
